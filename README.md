## Text Mining: Spotify Listenership

### Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises information on 3,000 songs sourced from Spotify, including various attributes such as track name, numerical features, and the target variable, 'has_listenership' (binary). The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be referenced via the following link: Spotify Songs Dataset

### Objectives
Numerical Variables Analysis: Investigate the relationship between the target variable and numerical attributes.
Track Name Analysis: Explore the association between the target variable and the track names.
Combined Feature Analysis: Analyze the relationship between the target variable and a combination of numerical variables and track names.
Topic Probability Analysis: Utilize text mining techniques to ascertain the probability of topics within the dataset.

### Methodology
1. Numerical Variables Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations between numerical features and the target variable. This may involve statistical tests and visualizations.
2. Track Name Analysis: Employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze track names. This could include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or word frequency analysis to understand the impact of track names on listenership.
3. Combined Feature Analysis: Merge numerical and textual features to gain deeper insights into the relationship between song attributes and listenership. This may involve feature engineering and advanced modeling techniques.
4. Topic Probability Analysis: Utilize topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify prevalent themes within the dataset. Compute the probability distribution of topics and assess their relevance to listenership.

### Importance of Analysis
Understanding the factors influencing listenership on Spotify is crucial for artists, music labels, and streaming platforms. By leveraging text mining and statistical analysis, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, playlist curation, and content creation, ultimately maximizing audience engagement and listenership.
